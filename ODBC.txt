Notes about ODBC support
========================

Starting at release 0.3.4, Winprint HylaFAX Reloaded supports address book from ODBC data sources, thus giving you the ability to store your address book on a variety of databases.
Note that ODBC support is still almost experimental. It has been tested with the following data sources: SQL Server, MySQL, Firebird, Excel.
ODBC connection is read only. This means Winprint HylaFAX Reloaded won't be able to store new items into your database. I'm sure this is desirable for most system administrators.
For those who need write access to the database, there are three opportunities:
(1) download source code and do the modifications themselves
(2) be patient (no timeline at all)
(3) hire me

-- Note about Excel --
----------------------
The columns containing the names and the fax numbers MUST be in text format.
To read data from an Excel spreadsheet with ODBC, you must define a "Named Range" inside your spreadsheet.
Have a look here to learn how to do this: http://spreadsheets.about.com/od/exceltips/qt/named_range.htm

Example:
Suppose you have a spreadsheet like the following:

      A        B
1  Name      Fax Number
2  John      012345678
3  Mary      876543210
4  Bob       019283746
...

You can create a named range on A:B (which means the entire column A plus the entire column B) and name it, let's say, "AddrBook".
Then you create an ODBC source (using ODBC administration tool) that points to your .xls file, and name it, let's say, "AddrBookDSN".
The parameters for Winprint HylaFAX Reloaded are:
Address book type  : ODBC
DSN                : AddrBookDSN (our ODBC data source name)
Username, Password : leave blank
Table              : AddrBook    (our named range)
Name field         : Name        (heading of column A)
Fax field          : Fax Number  (heading of column B)
