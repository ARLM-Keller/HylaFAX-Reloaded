Version 0.4.7 (under development)
# fixed some translations
# added support for multi-number recipients
# improved job submission result message
# added -regex <expression|"default"> and -noregex command line switches to override the "Number capture enabled" configuration option
  the -regex switch wants an additional parameter, that can be either:
	  - a regular expression, overriding the one set in configuration, or
		- the word "default" which means "just turn number capture on, and use whatever regex is set in the configuration"
  the -noregex switch merely turns number capture off.
